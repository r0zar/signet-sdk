# Vision for Signet SDK

## Purpose
The Signet SDK provides a seamless bridge between web applications and the Signet extension, enabling secure handling of cryptographic operations with a simple, developer-friendly API.

## Core Principles
1. **Security** - Prioritize the secure handling of all cryptographic operations
2. **Simplicity** - Offer an intuitive API that minimizes integration complexity
3. **Reliability** - Ensure consistent behavior across all supported browsers
4. **Compatibility** - Support seamless integration with modern web frameworks
5. **Documentation** - Provide clear, comprehensive documentation for developers

## Target Audience
- Web3 developers building applications requiring secure signing capabilities
- Frontend developers integrating cryptographic features into web applications
- Businesses building secure services on the web

## Long-term Vision
Establish a standard interface for secure cryptographic operations in the browser, making signature capabilities a natural extension of web development.
